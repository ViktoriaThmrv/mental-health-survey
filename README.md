# Mental Health Survey Analysis using SQL

This project involves the analysis of a mental health survey dataset exported from Kaggle using PostgreSQL and visualization using Tableau. The dataset contains information about respondents' demographics, employment status, and mental health treatment seeking behavior. The aim is to explore patterns and correlations within the data to gain insights into mental health treatment trends among survey participants. 

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey/code?datasetId=311&searchQuery=sql).

## SQL Queries
The SQL queries in this project are used to perform various analyses on the mental health survey dataset. Here are some examples of the analyses conducted:
- Standardizing gender values
- Counting the number of respondents who have sought treatment for mental health issues
- Calculating the overall percentage of respondents who have sought treatment for mental health issues
- Analyzing the percentage of male and female respondents who have sought treatment
- Exploring the correlation between remote work and mental health treatment
- Investigating the likelihood of seeking treatment based on company size

## Usage
To replicate the analysis:
1. Download the mental health survey dataset from Kaggle.
2. Set up a PostgreSQL database and import the dataset.
3. Run the provided SQL queries on the imported dataset to perform the analyses.

## Conclusion
Through this analysis, valuable insights can be gained into mental health treatment trends among individuals in the tech industry, which can inform policies and interventions aimed at improving mental health support in the workplace.
